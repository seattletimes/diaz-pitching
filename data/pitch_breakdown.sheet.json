    "comment": "This is what we call the load position. At that point, the (front) leg has reached its highest point over the rubber and he's got separation -- meaning hand out of the glove. You can see the leg is up around the belt area, he's got the glove out and he's got a nice strong front side. It's a good position."

    "comment": "Here's where he gets a little funky. In this position, when he initiates his move forward, he leads out with his heal, which is good. A lot of times, he'll get quick and pull his front side out. But he's got his front arm up in a strong position when he throws the glove out. That's part of the funk and deception that he creates. It's really not a bad position. And once he gets down to foot strike, you'll see he's in a really good spot."

    "comment": "He's starting to leave the rubber. He's down at foot strike with his chest out. You can see the hand and the elbow are out over the front side. Thatâ€™s what we call our power position and that's where he gets real violent from that point on with his movement forward before foot strike."

    "comment": "That's just his finish. That's actual a good finish for him. He doesn't always finish like that in a game. You'll see his head and chest out over his front side and a lot of the times he finishes off to the side where his head and chest have worked around the front leg. But that's a good position there."
