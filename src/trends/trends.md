On the ninth pitch of his first appearance in the majors, Edwin Diaz  fired a second strike past the Indians’ Rajai Davis. The reading on the stadium radar gun: 100.3 mph.

It was the 13th-fastest out of 24 100-mph-plus pitches Diaz would throw from his June 6 debut to the end of the 2016 season. 

Yet those two dozen hundred-plus heaters comprised only a sliver of the total across baseball. 

Thanks largely to the Yankees’ Aroldis Chapman,  MLB pitchers combined to throw 1,379 pitches that clocked triple digits in 2016, the most prolific year of flamethrowers the game has seen. That’s a 53.7 percent increase over 2015 and nearly 1,000 more than 2010, the year a 22-year-old Chapman debuted in the Reds’ bullpen.

What in 2008 was a group of eight led by Joel Zumaya had swelled to 34 pitchers to hit 100 mph in 2015 and 31 in 2016 — including four Mariners, more than any other team.

“Part of the excitement is keeping one eye on the scoreboard,” said Jonathan Hock, the director of the documentary “Fastball.” “When guys like Diaz step up, what are you gonna see? You remember that more than anything that happened in the game. It used to be that the home run was the slam dunk of baseball. Now it’s the 100-mph fastball. When you see triple digits on the scoreboard, it is really exciting. If can hear it in the crowd, you can feel the electricity.”

It took all of 13 Class AAA starts in 2010 of Chapman showcasing his record-breaking fastball but little else for the Reds to cut the string and allow his two-pitch repertoire to begin dominating out of the big league bullpen. Six years later, Diaz entered the eighth inning of  Class AA Jackson’s game and the next day general manager Jerry Dipoto announced the Mariners were doing the same.

“We felt like as a starter he’s mostly 90-94 mph with a good slider,” Dipoto said at the time. “What happens when we dump him into a bullpen? Do we have a chance to get that back-end dynamic arm? And does that supersede the ceiling that he would have as a starter?”

Diaz’s early success was quantifiable, no matter your bent. His stat line included an average of nearly two punchouts an inning (15.33 K/9), a 2.79 ERA and an even lower FIP, 2.04. It took him only 51⅔ innings to accumulate 1.9 fWAR. Perhaps more impressive was his ability to blow his tailing four-seamer past batters and intermix a sweeping slider.

When the Reds converted Chapman, then-GM Walt Jocketty’s intentions were for it only to be temporary. Dipoto has shown no indication of considering moving Diaz, his slender frame and fastball-slider combo back into the rotation.

Despite the Reds returning each of the next two spring trainings to the infatuation of starting pitcher Aroldis Chapman, he inked a five-year, $86 million contract with the Yankees this offseason having never started a major league game. It was the largest contract ever given to a reliever, followed only by Kenley Jansen and Mark Melancon’s deals, all completed in the first two weeks of December 2016. 

Teams are spending more than they ever have on their bullpens, up 18.8 percent and nearly $100 million league-wide from 2016. Just to complete their bullpen, the Mariners handed 31-year-old middle reliever Marc Rzepczynski $5.5 million. But with no big-money closer, Seattle dedicates barely 10 percent of its payroll to the bullpen — higher than only six other teams in baseball, and with its star closer making the league minimum.
